Building a Robot as a cute toy for children


We have created a robot that can follow light and stop when it encounters obstacles. 
Our team of 5 members took charge of the entire project, from designing to manufacturing, to ensure that the final product met all the necessary standards. 
We utilized Tinker Card for design purposes and 3D printing technology with PLA filament to bring the robot to life. 
The robot was built using the Arduino platform and features ultrasonic proximity sensors and LED lights.
